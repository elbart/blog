# Hello World
Greetings, dear reader! I am new to writing and publishing written content to
the interwebs. My name is Tim and I live in Leipzig, Germany. I am a happy
husband and father and most of my work and even free-time is dedicated to
technology - mostly software.

Most of my former professional life I was working as a Software Engineer,
Co-Founder and CTO of CeleraOne (now acquired by [Piano](https://piano.io/)) and
Software Architect. When producing software, I mostly did that with python,
nginx (openresty), Lua, Memcache, a little C++ and used quite a bunch of other
technologies (databases, infrastructure automation). I went on sabbatical
in 2021 (yap, there could have been more suitable years that a pandemic year)
and enjoyed life with family and full free-time control. In my former free-time
I basically enjoy trying out all kinds of new technologies in the software
world, but mostly with a server-side or automation touch.

Nowadays, I work as a Freelance CTO and IT Consultant. When I write software, I
prefer writing backend code and infrastructural code mostly using the [Rust
Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). There is still a lot to learn
(I started to learn Rust back in 2018) but I really enjoy the openness of the
Rust community and strive to contribute once I feel ready for it.

I plan to write about various technical and tech management related topics and
want to create a habit of writing. 

If you have any feedback or things you want to let me know, feel free to contact
me at `tim [at] n2d [dot] io`.

In this sense:
```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, n2d.io!");
}
```
