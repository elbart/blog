# About n2d.io's writers

## About Tim Eggert
My name is Tim and I live in Leipzig, Germany. I am a happy husband and father
and most of my work and even free-time is dedicated to technology - mostly
software.

Most of my former professional life I was working as a Software Engineer,
Co-Founder and CTO of CeleraOne (now acquired by [Piano](https://piano.io/)) and
Software Architect. When producing software, I mostly did that with python,
nginx (openresty), Lua, Memcache, a little C++ and used quite a bunch of other
technologies (databases, infrastructure automation). I went on sabbatical
in 2021 (yap, there could have been more suitable years that a pandemic year)
and enjoyed life with family and full free-time control. In my former free-time
I basically enjoy trying out all kinds of new technologies in the software
world, but mostly with a server-side or automation touch.

Nowadays, I work as a Freelance CTO and IT Consultant. When I write software, I
prefer writing backend code and infrastructural code mostly using the [Rust
Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/). There is still a lot to learn
(I started to learn Rust back in 2018) but I really enjoy the openness of the
Rust community and strive to contribute once I feel ready for it.

Hobbies off the digital world usually include:
- listening to a wide range of music (classical music (mostly instrumenal only),
  punkrock, hardcore, post-hardcore, metalcore, black-, death-, melodic death-,
  thrash-metal and what not).
- playing electric guitar (pretty old Aria Pro II - Stratocaster),
- riding my gravel bike,
- reading books (I only started this habit a few months ago).
